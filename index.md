# Mathew Paul

I'm a Software Engineer based out of {% extLink 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand' 'Aotearoa' %}. I'm experienced with Javascript, and I've worked with Vue, Cordova, Angular and NodeJS.

## About this site

I needed something simple (thinking of something fancy was taking far too long) to show my personal projects on and somewhere to post blog posts so here we are. This site is built with {% extLink 'https://www.11ty.dev/' 'Eleventy' %}, mostly using {% extLink 'https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/' 'Nunjucks templates' %} and Markdown.

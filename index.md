# Mathew Paul

I'm a Software Engineer based out of {% extLink 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand' 'Aotearoa' %}. I'm experienced with Javascript, and I've worked with Vue, Cordova, Angular and NodeJS.

## About this site

I just wanted to build something that was quick to load, and accesible, with minimal design. This is just a place to show a few personal projects and share my thoughts. This site is built with {% extLink 'https://www.11ty.dev/' 'Eleventy' %}, mostly using {% extLink 'https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/' 'Nunjucks templates' %} and Markdown.

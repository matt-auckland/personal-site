Seems appropriate to throw a post up on here so it's not empty.

Welcome, I'll be using this site to post a mixture of the usual programming stuff (personal projects, fixes for annoying bugs I encountered, bike shedding, etc), as well as miscellaneous thoughts and probably some pontification.

Hope you find some value in reading what I write.
